#symbols.
#a symbol is very similar to a string, but optimized to stand for something.


#there is only ever one instance of a symbol.

# a = :all
# b = a
# c = :all
#
# puts a == c
# puts c === a
#
# puts :all
# puts c

 # author = 'jules verne'
 # title = 'from earth to the moon'
 #
 # hash = { author => title }
 #
 # puts hash

# the_symbol = :all
# puts the_symbol

e = :all
r = :all
i = :all
k = :all



#just use strings to create an intelligble item that stands for something.
